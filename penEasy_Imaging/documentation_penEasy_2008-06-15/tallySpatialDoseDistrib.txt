TALLY SPATIAL DOSE DISTRIBUTION

* The absorbed dose per simulated history is tallied in the x-interval
  [XMIN,XMAX], using NXBIN bins. Corresponding intervals and bins are
  defined for the y and z axis. The resulting bins allow the scoring of a
  3D spatial dose distribution.

  To facilitate the preparation of graphs with steps, two values for each
  coordinate are printed in each row, namely, the low-end and the middle
  point of each bin.

* The 3D distribution can be integrated to obtain a 2D or 1D distribution.
  If, for example, NXBIN is set to zero, the absorbed dose is integrated
  along the x axis, thus yielding a 2D distribution in y and z. That is to
  say, the scoring region along the x axis is taken to be [-infty,+infty].
  Analogous procedures are applied along the y and z axis according to the
  values of NYBIN and NZBIN, respectively.

  For instance, a planar detector with infinite lateral dimensions (i.e. a
  slab) and perpendicular to the z axis can be defined by setting NXBIN=
  NYBIN=0, NZBIN=1. In this case, the units of the reported result are
  cm^2*eV/g because the dose is integrated over x and y.

* In order to obtain its mass density, it is assumed that each bin (either
  in 1D, 2D or 3D) contains a single material, i.e. it is homogeneous. The
  mass density of each bin is evaluated at its center.

* This tally should not be used to compute absorbed dose inside voxelized
  regions. This is because, as described previously, this tally may report
  erroneous results if bins are not homogeneous. Inhomogeneities may arise
  because some bins may overlap with more than one voxel, if their sizes do
  not match, or with voxels and quadric bodies, if both are used.

* If NXBIN=0 the values XMIN,XMAX are irrelevant, except for the fact that
  the middle point x=(XMIN+XMAX)/2 is used to evaluate the mass density of
  the entire region x=[-infty,+infty].

* If 'PRINT COORDINATES' is set to 1, the values of x,y,z are printed in
  the report. Otherwise, they are not. Notice that, in order to interpret
  the various columns in the output file, the gnuplot scripts for this
  tally distributed with penEasy assume that this option has been set to 1.

* The RELATIVE UNCERTAINTY REQUESTED (specified as a percentage) is used as
  a criterion to decide when to stop the simulation (see Instructions in
  penEasy.in).
