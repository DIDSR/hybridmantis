TALLY PARTICLE TRACK STRUCTURE

* This tally allows the representation of particle tracks in a 3D graph. To
  this end, particle coordinates after each interaction (together with some
  other information) are written to an external file. This file is used by
  the corresponding gnuplot script to display the tracks.

* To prevent creating enormous files with myriads of particle tracks that
  would be virtually impossible to discern when displayed on the computer
  screen, only the first K simulated histories are reported. The number K
  is set by the user in the input file.
