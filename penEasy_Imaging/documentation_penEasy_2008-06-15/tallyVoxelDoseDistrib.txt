TALLY VOXEL DOSE DISTRIBUTION

* The absorbed dose per simulated history in each volume element (voxel)
  is tallied for the region of interest (ROI) defined in the input file.
  The ROI is defined in terms of a range of x, y and z indices.

* If the ROI for a given coordinate is set to (0,0), then the effective ROI
  goes from 1 up to the last voxel.

* In the field INCLUDE QUADRICS CONTRIBUTION users may select whether the
  fraction of a voxel covered by quadric bodies should be counted when
  computing its mass and absorbed dose or not.

* If PRINT MASS is set to 1 (i.e. YES), the mass of each voxel is also
  printed. It is evaluated during the initialization of the code by
  integrating numerically the mass density over the voxel volume.

* If 'PRINT COORDINATES' is set to 1, the coordinates for each voxel are
  printed in the report. To facilitate graphical representations, two
  values for each cartesian coordinate are given in each row, namely, the
  low end and the middle point of each voxel. Notice that, in order to
  correctly interpret the various columns in the output file, the gnuplot
  script for this tally assumes that this option has been set to 1.

* The RELATIVE UNCERTAINTY REQUESTED (specified as a percentage) is used as
  a criterion to decide when to stop the simulation (see Instructions in
  penEasy.in).
