TALLY PHASE SPACE FILE

* The state of all particles reaching the specified DETECTION MATERIAL is
  written in the output file. More precisely, the variables written are, in
  the quoted order, kpar, e, x, y, z, u, v, w, wght, dn, ilb(1), ilb(2),
  ilb(3), ilb(4) and ilb(5) (i.e. type of particle, energy, position,
  direction, statistical weight, and ILB labels).

* The meaning of each variable is explained in the PENELOPE manual, except
  DN, which is the increment in the number of top primary histories since
  the previous record in the PSF was written. Thus DN=0 indicates that the
  current particle belongs to the same history as the previous one and DN=
  3, for instance, implies that it was necessary to simulate 3 additional
  primary histories until a particle reached again the PSF scoring region.

* Notice that the PSF is written in text mode (i.e. ASCII) and that each
  variable is separated from the next by one or more spaces. Given that a
  non-negligible fraction of the time needed to simulate each history is
  spent accessing the information in the PSF record, this format is
  obviously not optimized for speed. It was chosen this way because it is
  human-readable and directly amenable to graphical representation, e.g.
  with gnuplot. However, for production runs, a binary format
  ("unformatted", in the Fortran jargon) is more convenient. See the file
  sourcePhaseSpaceFile.txt for a discussion on how to implement the latter.

* In order to terminate particles that reach the detector, the three
  absortion energies (photons, e- and e+) for the detection material must
  be set to infinity (i.e. a very large value). If this is not done, some
  particles may re-enter the material in question and be counted more than
  once. This latter situation may be a desirable feature in some
  applications.

* DETECTION MATERIAL should not be null (i.e. vacuum). This is so because
  STEP, the geometry subroutine from PENGEOM (in the PENELOPE package),
  skips vacuum regions with the intention to reach out in search of some
  non-vacuum material further downstream. If it does not encounter any
  matter, the spatial coordinates are returned with very large values,
  rendering the scoring of the particle's position pointless. Instead, it
  is recommended that you define a fake material, a pseudo-vacuum, with a
  very small mass density. This will prevent STEP from pushing particles to
  infinity and will allow the tally routine to stop them when it is
  detected that they enter the pseudo-vacuum region.

* The PSF name is defined in the corresponding field.
