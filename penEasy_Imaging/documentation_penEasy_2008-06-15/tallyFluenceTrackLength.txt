TALLY FLUENCE TRACK LENGTH

* The fluence spectrum integrated over the volume of the declared DETECTION
  MATERIAL is calculated. The fluence is reported per unit simulated
  history. Its units are cm^3*particles/(eV*cm^2) = particles*cm/eV. To
  obtain it, the track length estimator is used, that is, the distance
  travelled by each particle type in the detector is accumulated according
  to the energy of the considered particle.

* The spectrum is obtained by dividing the interval [EMIN,EMAX] (in eV) in
  the specified No. OF E BINS. A logarithmic scale is used. To facilitate
  the preparation of graphs with steps two energies are printed in each
  row, namely, the low end and the middle point of each bin.

* The energy deposited in the DETECTION MATERIAL per simulated history is
  also reported. For electrons and positrons, this quantity is NOT
  calculated from the values returned by KNOCK (which would correspond to
  the so-called collision estimator) but from the product
  trackLength*restrictedStoppingPower. Events that deposit energy through
  mechanisms other than the one just described are also taken into account
  and their contribution to the total energy deposition is also reported
  separately for the sake of completeness. These mechanisms include, e.g.,
  the so called track-ends, Compton collisions in which the energy
  transferred to the secondary electron is less that its absorption energy
  (and consequently this electron is assumed to be locally deposited), etc.

* The RELATIVE UNCERTAINTY REQUESTED (specified as a percentage) is used as
  a criterion to decide when to stop the simulation (see Instructions in
  penEasy.in).

* IMPORTANT: To operate properly, this tally requires a slight modification
  of the PENELOPE subroutine KNOCK. The modification implies no change in
  the physics, only the access to more information than the one provided by
  the standard KNOCK. Thus, a subroutine KNOCKX is provided elsewhere in
  the penEasy package.
