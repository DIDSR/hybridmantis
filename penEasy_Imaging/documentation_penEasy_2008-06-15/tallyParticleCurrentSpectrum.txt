TALLY PARTICLE CURRENT SPECTRUM

* This tally reports, classified according to the particle type, the energy
  spectrum of the particles that enter the specified DETECTION MATERIAL per
  unit simulated history. The total number of each type of particle per
  simulated history is also reported.

* Each particle is counted as many times as it enters the DETECTION
  MATERIAL. If this feature is not wanted, the absorption energy of the
  material in question must be set to infinity. A count is also added to
  the particle current counter if the particle is generated inside the
  detection material by the source.

* The energy bins are determined by the EMIN, EMAX (both in eV) and the
  No. OF E BINS indicated in the input file. To facilitate the
  preparation of graphs with steps two energies are printed in each row,
  namely, the low end and the middle point of each bin.

* The RELATIVE UNCERTAINTY REQUESTED (specified as a percentage) is used as
  a criterion to decide when to stop the simulation (see Instructions in
  penEasy.in).
