TALLY CYLINDRICAL DOSE DISTRIBUTION

* The absorbed dose per simulated history is tallied in the r interval
  [RMIN,RMAX], using NRBIN bins, where r stands for the radial distance
  sqrt(x^2+y^2).
  Corresponding intervals and bins are defined for the z axis. The
  resulting volume elements allow the scoring of a cylindrical dose
  distribution.

  To facilitate the preparation of graphs with steps, two values for each
  coordinate are printed in each row. For the z coordinate these values are
  the low-end and the middle point of each bin. For the r coordinate they
  are the low-end and an average radial distance r_ave. This latter
  quantity is a weighted average with a weight proportional to r. This
  results in r_ave = 2/3*(r'^3-r^3)/(r'^2-r^2), where r and r' are the low
  and high-ends of the bin, respectively.

* The 3D distribution can be integrated over z to obtain a 2D distribution.
  Thus, if NZBIN is set to zero the absorbed dose is integrated along the z
  axis, yielding a 2D distribution that depends only on r. Put in other
  words, the scoring region along the z axis is taken to be [-infty,
  +infty]. In this case, the units of the reported result are cm*eV/g.

* In order to obtain its mass density, it is assumed that each cylindrical
  bin contains a single material, i.e. it is homogeneous. The mass density
  of each bin is evaluated at (x=rmid,y=0,z), where rmid is the average
  between the low and high-end radii of the bin.

* This tally should not be used to compute absorbed dose inside voxelized
  regions. This is because, as described previously, this tally may report
  erroneous results if bins are not homogeneous. Inhomogeneities may arise
  because some bins may overlap with more than one voxel or with voxels and
  quadric bodies, if both are used.

* If NZBIN=0 the values ZMIN,ZMAX are irrelevant, except for the fact that
  the middle point z=(ZMIN+ZMAX)/2 is used to evaluate the mass density of
  the entire region z=[-infty,+infty].

* If 'PRINT COORDINATES' is set to 1, the values of r,z are printed in the
  report. Otherwise, they are not. Notice that, in order to interpret the
  various columns in the output file, the gnuplot scripts for this tally
  distributed with penEasy assume that this option has been set to 1.

* The RELATIVE UNCERTAINTY REQUESTED (specified as a percentage) is used as
  a criterion to decide when to stop the simulation (see Instructions in
  penEasy.in).
