SOURCE BOX ISOTROPIC GAUSS SPECTRUM

This source model has a considerable flexibility, allowing the definition
of a wide variety of source shapes and spectra. The notes below describe
the various options in detail.


**** ENERGY ****

* An energy spectrum is given, below the corresponding header, as a
  piecewise function. Each entry in the spectrum contains two numbers,
  namely, the starting energy of a channel and its probability, which needs
  not be normalized to unity. The list ends whenever a negative probability
  is found. The particle energy is sampled with uniform probability inside
  a randomly selected channel.

  For example, the two most prominent Co-60 lines can be defined as follows:

  Energy(eV) Probability (Probabilities do not need to be normalized to 1)
  1.17e6     99.97       1st channel: [1.17,1.17] MeV with prob~99.97
  1.17e6      0.0        2nd channel: [1.17,1.33] MeV, no emissions
  1.33e6     99.99       3rd channel: [1.33,1.33] MeV with prob~99.99
  1.33e6     -1          A negative value signals the end of the spectrum

  A continuous spectrum would look like this:

  Energy(eV) Probability (Probabilities do not need to be normalized to 1)
  0.5e6        2.1       1st channel: [0.5,0.6] MeV with prob~2.1
  0.6e6        3.7       2nd channel: [0.6,0.7] MeV with prob~3.7
  0.7e6        5.2       3rd channel: [0.7,0.8] MeV with prob~5.2
  0.8e6        7.0       etc...
  0.9e6        4.9       Last channel is [0.9,1.0] MeV
  1.0e6       -1         A negative value signals the end of the spectrum

  Note that a combination of continuous and discrete spectra is possible by
  mixing channels of finite and null width.

* If there is only a single channel (i.e. two entries in the list) and its
  probability is null, the source is then assumed to have a Gaussian
  spectrum truncated at +-6*sigma (or zero). If E(1) and E(2) stand for the
  two energies entered, the mean energy is set to (E(1)+E(2))/2 and the
  full width at half maximum (FWHM) to E(2)-E(1). Recall that
  FWHM = sigma*sqrt(8*ln(2)) = 2.35482*sigma.

  For instance, the table:

  Energy(eV) Probability
  0.9e6        0.0        A single channel with null probability
  1.1e6        -1

  defines a Gaussian distribution with mean = (0.9+1.1)/2 = 1.0 MeV and
  FWHM =  1.1-0.9 = 0.2 MeV (i.e. sigma = 84.932 keV).


**** DIRECTION OF EMISSION ****

* The emission is isotropic within a cone. The cone axis lies along the
  (unnormalized) given DIRECTION VECTOR and has a certain APERTURE, given
  as the maximum angle (in degrees from 0 up to 180) between the direction
  of flight of an emitted particle and the axis of symmetry of the cone.
  APERTURE=0 is forward emission (null solid angle) and APERTURE=180
  implies fully isotropic emission (solid angle is 4*PI).


**** SPATIAL POSITION ****

* Particles are generated inside a rectangular box that will be referred to
  as the source box. Its size is given by specifying, in cm, its three
  SIDES (i.e. along the x, y and z directions).

* The source box can be rotated to better suit the geometry of the source
  being defined. To this end, three EULER ANGLES are given in deg. The
  first angle involves a rotation around the z axis; the second, a rotation
  around the original y axis; and the third, a rotation again around the
  original z axis.

* After rotating the position vector, it is shifted so that the source box
  is centered at the position specified as the CENTER COORDINATES.

* It is also possible to specify in what MATERIAL of the quadric geometry
  to be simulated should the particles be generated. This is done as
  follows.

  Initial particle positions are sampled inside the source box. If
  MATERIAL>0 the particle is accepted only if the index of the material
  where it lies coincides with MATERIAL (however, see below the particular
  case of a point source). Otherwise it is rejected and re-sampled. This
  case is intended to define radioactive sources, in which primary
  particles are emitted inside objects with complex shapes. Of course, a
  source box large enough to contain the desired material object must be
  provided.

  If, on the other hand, MATERIAL=0 the particle position is accepted
  regardless of the material in which it is located. If its position lies
  initially in vacuum, it is moved forward until either it enters the
  simulated object or escapes to infinity. In this latter case the returned
  material index is zero and the main program must provide safeguards to
  detect this. This model is intended to describe simple radiation fields,
  such as pencil or conical beams. Note that in the penEasy main program
  particles emitted but not aiming at the object are effectively counted as
  simulated histories, a fact that must be taken into account when
  interpreting simulation results, which are always expressed on a per-
  history basis.

* The procedure described above applies also for voxelized geometries.
  Notice that, if a material is selected by setting MATERIAL>0, the source
  has a constant emission intensity per unit volume. For quadric
  geometries, and since bodies of the same material are homogeneous, this
  also implies that the source has a constant emission intensity per unit
  mass. When voxelized geometries are used, however, different voxels may
  contain the same material but with varying mass densities. In this latter
  case, therefore, voxels (and quadric bodies) inside the source box and
  made of the selected material emit a uniform number of particles per unit
  volume, but not necessarily per unit mass.

* In the particular case of a point source (i.e. when the source box has
  sides of null length), the meaning of MATERIAL>0 is different. In this
  case a particle's direction is accepted if the position falls inside that
  material or if it *points* at it. This case is conceived to describe
  beams that produce radiation fields of complex shapes. An example can be
  a gamma point source immersed in air with a surrounding shield (not
  included in the simulation) intended to produce a rectangular field on a
  certain distant plane.

  In this example the user should include in the geometry file a thin
  rectangular body of the desired field dimensions and in contact with the
  distant plane. This body should be made of a material that does not
  appear anywhere else, say mat=3. By setting MATERIAL to 3 in the input
  file, only particles aimed at the rectangular field will be accepted.
  Care must be exercised when setting the DIRECTION and APERTURE to make
  sure that the defined cone completely "illuminates" the body intended to
  define the field. Notice that to decide whether or not the particle
  points at MATERIAL the presence of other intermediate materials, such as
  the air in the former example, is ignored.
