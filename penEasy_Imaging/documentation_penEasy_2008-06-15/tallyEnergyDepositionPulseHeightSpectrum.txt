TALLY ENERGY DEPOSITION PULSE HEIGHT SPECTRUM

* The total energy deposited in the DETECTION MATERIAL per simulated
  history is reported.

* Also, the energy deposited by each history in the specified DETECTION
  MATERIAL is classified into energy bins (pulse height spectrum). More
  precisely, the quantity reported is the number of events per simulated
  history in each bin, divided by the bin width. This coincides with the
  normalized probability distribution of the deposited energy.

* Energy bins are determined by the EMIN, EMAX (both in eV) and the No. OF
  E BINS indicated in the input file. To facilitate the preparation of
  graphs with steps two energies are printed in each row, namely, the low
  end and the middle point of each bin.

* The RELATIVE UNCERTAINTY REQUESTED (specified as a percentage) is used as
  a criterion to decide when to stop the simulation (see Instructions in
  penEasy.in).
