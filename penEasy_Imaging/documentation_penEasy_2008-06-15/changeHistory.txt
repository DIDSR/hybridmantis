v. 2008-06-15

* The gnuplot scripts for the VDD tally assume that no coordinates are
  present in the DAT file. This is to save disk space, since usually
  voxelized geometries contain millions of voxels and storing the cartesian
  coordinates for each and every one of them is redundant.

* Gnuplot scripts containing sequences of images have been modified to
  include 'frameRate' as the pause interval. By default it is -1, except
  for the VDD tally, where it is set to a positive value to produce a
  'movie'.

* The penVox algorithm has been modified to allow: (i) vacuum cavities; and
  (ii) a transparent material (or equivalently, body) that does not need to
  be smaller than the voxels bounding box (VBB). The tolerances of the
  algorithm have also been modified to take into account (ii).

* A routine that writes a separate file with the voxels mass and sign has
  been added. This can be used in future versions of the code to allow
  initialization of voxels mass from this file. Given that, for large
  granularities, the computation of the voxels mass may take a sizeable
  amount of time (~1 min for granul=100), this possibility can save time
  when simulating the same geometry several times.

* A switch has been added to allow users to specify whether they want the
  voxels mass (and dose) to be computed including the contribution of
  quadric materials in overlapped voxels or not (sort of a partial volume
  effect).

* The VDD tally, when asked to report voxels mass, also reports the voxels
  sign.

* The arrays DENSVOX and IDENSVOX in the penVox common have been changed to
  single precision to save computer memory.

* A set of routines to allow the creation of PSFs in IAEA binary format
  have been included. Only the PENELOPE label ILB(5) is considered when
  writing (or reading) PSFs in this format--ILB(1:4) are ignored.

* For standard penEasy (ASCII) phase-space files (PSF), the contents has
  changed. The 2006-compliant data format, consisting of
    KPAR : E : X : Y : Z : U : V : W : WGHT : ILB(5) : DeltaN
  has been substituted by
    KPAR : E : X : Y : Z : U : V : W : WGHT : DeltaN : ILB(1:5)
  which includes ILB values from 1 to 5. The PSF source is capable of
  identifying whether the 2008 or pre-2008 formats are used, and act
  accordingly. In either case, the first line of the PSF must contain the
  appropriate header, as produced by the corresponding version of the PSF
  tally.

* The codes in command.in have been redefined. Now it is also possible to
  introduce multiple commands in a single update cycle.

* In the input section of TallyParticleTrackStructure, the field defining
  every how many histories a track must be reported has been removed. It
  was superfluous.

* BUG FIXED in tallyVoxelDoseDistrib.f. VDD counters were not correctly
  initialized to zero. The fact that tests were passed is perhaps caused by
  the compiler setting to zero all arrays at init time.

* BUG FIXED in penvox.f. Array RHO, containing the mass density of each
  material present in the simulation, was invoked by INIVOX() before PEINIT
  was called. Since PEINIT sets RHO, the latter was undefined at the time
  it was invoked, (it was probably set to zero by the compiler) and so the
  mass of overlapped voxels was incorrectly determined. This is actually
  irrelevant for the transport itself since the sign, which determines
  whether or not the voxel is overlapped, was correctly set anyway. But it
  affects the computation of the dose by the VDD tally in overlapped
  voxels.

* BUG FIXED in penaux.f. The forcing initialization routine contains a
  single weight window, but the input file allowed the definition of one
  for each forcing line entered. As a result, only the window defined in
  the last line entered in the forcing section mattered. i.e., in the line
  with MAT=0. The input file has also been fixed to make clear that only a
  single weight window is present in the simulation.

* BUG FIXED in sourcePhaseSpaceFile.txt. The following facts caused a
  conflict: (i) Several tallies store the history number after a call to
  TALLY(1,N); (ii) This tally call takes place *before* the call to
  SOURCE(N); (iii) But the PSF source modifies N to adjust it to the actual
  value read from the PSF. As a result, the value N passed by TALLY(1,N)
  was incorrect. Note that point (ii) cannot be changed, since SOURCE calls
  TALLY(0,E) to store the primary particles energy E and at this point some
  tallies need to know the correct history number. The adopted solution was
  to add another tally mode, TALLY(2,N), which is invoked by sourcePSF to
  inform other potentially interested tallies that N has changed.

v. 2008-03-01

* Support for voxelized geometries (possibly combined with quadrics) has
  been included based on the penVox algorithm.

* All plotting scripts have been adapted to gnuplot 4.2 patchlevel 3.
  Basically, this involved adding 'implicit' to the 'set pm3d' instruction,
  since in the new version the default pm3d mode has been switched to
  explicit. As a result, 3D surfaces were not plotted--only the contours.
  Also, pointtypes (i.e. symbol codes) for the Win terminal have changed
  (apparently, for better consistency with the codes employed in other
  terminals, such as postscript) with the result that what was plotted as a
  solid dot in v 4.0 is now a hollow triangle.

* Output of tally reports to stdout has been supressed. Now, only DAT files
  contain the reported data.

* Cylindrical and radial tallies incorrectly reported average radius of
  first circular bin as being something different from zero. This has been
  corrected and now they report zero for the 1st bin.

* The introduction of some new features of Fortran 95 have rendered the
  code incompatible with the famous g77 compiler (e.g. by the use of 'i0'
  to write integer numbers).

* Various aesthetic improvements in the tally reports have been introduced.

* The documentation has been revised and extended.

* The main program name was changed from penmain to penEasy.

* BUG FIXED in penEasy.f. The bug caused the code to stop when only tallies
  that do not report uncertainty were active (e.g. PSF).

* BUG FIXED in sourceBoxIsotropicGaussSpectrum.f. For point sources
  *aiming* at a specific material, the status of the particle actually
  defined by the source was the one that was reached after hitting the
  target material, not the one at the source position. (Pointed out by
  Andreu Badal.)

* BUG FIXED in sourceBoxIsotropicGaussSpectrum.f. The quantity 2*mc2 is now
  added to the max E if the source is a positron.

* BUG FIXED in penaux.f. If EABS>EMAX, PEINIT sets EABS to EMAX-eps,
  thus ruining any attempt to create a perfect absorbent. To avoid this
  behavior, EMAX is now defined to be slightly larger than the max source
  E.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
v. 2006-08-01

* Adapted to PENELOPE'2006.

* Data sections in input file have been changed to include a field that
  specifies whether the source/tally is ON or OFF. This avoids having to
  comment out the whole section to indicate that it is OFF and prevents
  misinterpretations caused by missing a section because of spelling errors
  in its header.

* New tallies developed: tallyCylindricalDoseDistrib and
  tallySphericalDoseDistrib. Their corresponding gnuplot scripts have also
  been prepared.

* Two new scripts for 3D spatial dose distributions have been included, one
  for color maps and the other for surface plots. Some other scripts have
  been polished.

* The report header from tallySpatialDoseDistrib has been improved.

* The data section for tallyParticleTrackStructure now includes a field
  that sets a limit to the number of history tracks to report (suggested by
  Andreu Badal).

v. 2006-06-01

* The relative uncertainty requested is now a quantity that can be defined
  independently in the input file for each tally. A minor change is that
  when nothing has been scored, the tally routines return a 0% uncertainty,
  instead of 100% as it was done before.

* penaux.f
  PEINIT is now invoked with the maximum energy provided by the active
  source routine. Previously, PEINIT was always initialized with 1 GeV.
  This change implies that sourcePhaseSpaceFile.f needed to be changed as
  well to take into account that the max energy returned by its init
  routine should add 2*mc^2 (~1.022 MeV) if there are e+'s present in the
  PSF.

* penmain.in
  Comment lines are now allowed in the input file by introducing a '#' in
  the first column.

* BUG FIXED in penmain.f
  In the 'particle' loop, the line
          if (absorb()) cycle particle
  has been inserted before
          call start
  This prevents START from stopping the simulation when E is out of range.

* BUG FIXED in tallyParticleTrackStructure.f
  Modified to account for particles leaving the source but not entering the
  object. Previously, these tracks were not correctly displayed.

* penmain.f
  The comment after call JUMP was mistaken.

* tallyPhaseSpaceFile.f, tallyPhaseSpaceFile.txt
  PSFTALLY has been modified so that it does not stop particles when they
  reach detection material. A particle may now re-enter the PSF detector
  many times, unless the absorption energies are set to +INF for that
  detector.

* penaux.f
  - ABSORB simplified (aesthetically).
  - FORCING can now be = 1 (before, only >1 accepted).

* penmain.in
  Default FORCING changed to 1.0 (it was 10.0)

* BUG FIXED in sourcePhaseSpaceFile.f
  Rotation angles for PSF, which are input as deg, were not converted into
  rad.

* BUG FIXED in gnuplot scripts for tallySpatialDoseDistrib.f
  The title should say eV/g... and not eV/cm...


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
v. 2005-10-26

* Adapted to PENELOPE'2005.

* The history counter N has been upgraded to REAL*8.

* Support for interaction forcing (a variance reduction technique available
  in PENELOPE) has been provided.

* Time routines have been adapted to the F95 standard.

* tallyParticleTrackStructure.f has been added and some gnuplot scripts
  improved.

* BUG FIXED in penmain.f
  CALL TALLY(1,N) in PENMAIN (stores the history number for later
  comparisons in TALLYSDD), has been moved *before* CALL SOURCE. This is
  necessary because SOURCE calls TALLY(0,e) and the latter assumes that the
  history number has already been stored previously. This may have caused
  the variance of the energy deposited in the spatial bin where the source
  was lying to be incorrectly calculated. Many thanks to Andreu Badal
  (Univ. Politecnica de Catalunya) for pointing this out.
