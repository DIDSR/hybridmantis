TALLY SPHERICAL DOSE DISTRIBUTION

* The absorbed dose per simulated history (in eV/g) is tallied in the r
  interval [RMIN,RMAX] using NRBIN bins, where r is the radial distance to
  the origin of coordinates, that is, r=sqrt(x^2+y^2+z^2).

  To facilitate the preparation of graphs with steps, two values for each
  coordinate are printed in each row, namely, the low-end and an average
  radius r_ave of the spherical bin. This latter quantity is a weighted
  average with a weight proportional to r squared. This results in r_ave =
  3/4*(r'^4-r^4)/(r'^3-r^3), where r and r' are the low and high-ends of
  the bin, respectively.

* In order to obtain its mass density, it is assumed that each spherical
  bin contains a single material, i.e. it is homogeneous. The mass density
  of each bin is evaluated at (x=0,y=0,z=rmid), where rmid is the average
  between the low and high- end radii of the bin.

* This tally should not be used to compute absorbed dose inside voxelized
  regions. This is because, as described previously, this tally may report
  erroneous results if bins are not homogeneous. Inhomogeneities may arise
  because some bins may overlap with more than one voxel or with voxels and
  quadric bodies, if both are used.

* If 'PRINT COORDINATES' is set to 1, the values of r are printed in the
  report. Otherwise, they are not. Notice that, in order to interpret the
  various columns in the output file, the gnuplot scripts for this tally
  distributed with penEasy assume that this option has been set to 1.

* The RELATIVE UNCERTAINTY REQUESTED (specified as a percentage) is used as
  a criterion to decide when to stop the simulation (see Instructions in
  penEasy.in).
